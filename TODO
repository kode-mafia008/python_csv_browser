 
🧩 Full-Stack Web App Assignment – Real-Time CSV Browser with Role-Based Access Control
Goal
Build a small full-stack web app that allows users to sign up, log in, and browse CSV files uploaded by an admin.
The app should feature real-time updates (new files appear instantly for all connected users) and role-based access control (RBAC) enforced via JWT.

🧱 Tech Stack
Frontend: React (any framework or toolchain — Vite, CRA, Next.js, etc.)
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Database: PostgreSQL
Auth: JWT-based authentication with role scopes (admin, user)
Preferred Tools: Using AI tools (ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) during development is encouraged and expected.

🏗️ Main Functionality
1. Authentication & Roles
Users can sign up and log in using username & password.
On signup, users are assigned the "user" role by default.
The admin user(s) can be manually seeded or flagged in the database.
JWT tokens include a role claim (e.g., {"sub": "tom", "role": "admin"}).
Access to routes is protected via FastAPI dependencies:
admin endpoints → upload/delete CSVs, manage users.
user endpoints → list and view CSVs only.
Make sure to use FastAPI dependencies.

2. Admin Panel
Admin can:
Log in with JWT.
Upload new CSV files.
See a list of uploaded files (name, size, upload date).
Delete any CSV file.
View all registered users and delete them if needed.
When the admin uploads or deletes a CSV file:
All connected clients (including other browser tabs) receive the update in real time via WebSocket.

3. User Panel
Regular users can:
Sign up, log in.
View the list of available CSVs.
Select one to view its contents rendered as a simple table.
See updates in real time when the admin uploads or removes CSVs (no manual refresh needed).

💾 Data Storage
Uploaded CSV files are stored in the local file system.
File metadata (path, name, size, uploader, upload date) is saved in PostgreSQL.
User credentials and roles are also stored in PostgreSQL.

💬 Real-Time Requirements
Use FastAPI WebSockets or Socket.IO to push updates to connected clients.
When a CSV is uploaded or deleted, emit an event (e.g., "csv_list_updated").
React clients should listen for these events and update the UI live.
💡 Bonus / Advanced Features
Secure JWT storage: Store access tokens using httpOnly cookies or localStorage with refresh logic.
Clean UI: Use Tailwind, Material UI, or Chakra.
CSV Visualization: Let users create simple bar or line charts for numeric columns (e.g., with Recharts or Plotly).
Search or pagination for CSV contents.
⚙️ Requirements & Expectations
Keep it simple but functional.
Clear separation between frontend and backend.
Readable, maintainable code structure.
No need for deployment or email verification.
Focus on correctness, code quality, and architecture.
